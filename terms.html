    <p>These terms and conditions (&quot;Agreement&quot;) set forth the general terms and conditions of your use of the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://omynote.com">omynote.com</a> website (&quot;Website&quot;), &quot;OMyNote App&quot; mobile application (&quot;Mobile Application&quot;) and any of their related products and services (collectively, &quot;Services&quot;). This Agreement is legally binding between you (&quot;User&quot;, &quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot;) and this Website operator and Mobile Application developer (&quot;Operator&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot;). By accessing and using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to this Agreement, in which case the terms &quot;User&quot;, &quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot; shall refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this Agreement, you must not accept this Agreement and may not access and use the Services. You acknowledge that this Agreement is a contract between you and the Operator, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by you, and it governs your use of the Services.</p>

You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account or any other breaches of security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.
